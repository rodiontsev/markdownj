MarkdownJ is the pure Java port of Markdown (a text-to-html conversion tool written by John Gruber).

This repository is an updated fork of rtyley/markdownj with some modifications.

Differences from rtyley/markdownj upstream:

  * Added support to links and images in headers blocks.
  * Added workaround for [the issue 6](http://code.google.com/p/markdownj/issues/detail?id=6)
